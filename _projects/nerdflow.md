Nerdflow was a project that was started by Jesper Lindstrom when he was 15, whereafter I joined at the age of 17 to help recoding parts towards the CodeIgniter framework. Nerdflow was designed to be a social network for developers where they could find jobs, post code, chat with people. It was shut down in the same year since Facebook was too popular.
