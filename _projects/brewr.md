# Brewr

## General

Brewr was a project that I started back in June 2015. The intention of this project was for companies to be able to manage their development environments, and get their developers up and working within minutes instead of hours. This solution was based on a simple to use GUI system that could work on Mac, Windows and Linux operating systems so that companies would not need any inner knowledge of the development languages. It was made possible by cutting edge technology such as Docker and Electron.

## My Role

I started this project and did the complete development part on the Backend and the Frontend, next to that I also designed the Dashboard with all itâ€™s subsections.

## Outcome

Eventually I halted the project due to a lack of time, maybe in the future I will resume and finish it, but until then you can find the source code here: https://github.com/thebillkidy/Brewr-Site
