# KumulAid

## General

KumulAid is a website where people can donate for the charity that they support, by partnering with companies we are able to match users their donations and make a bigger impact. For example, when a user donates 10Eur, we are able to give the charity 20Eur because of this matching component.

## My Role

As a CTO my rule was to manage the complete technical side of the platform, this included developing the whole website system and donation system for both the Backend and Frontend.

## Outcome

I left this project to focus on my own career path at Microsoft, to get more technical and get to know strategy at a high level.
