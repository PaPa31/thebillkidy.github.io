# Feedient

## General

Feedient was a social media aggregator which goal was to unify and gather all social feeds into one easy-to-use overview. The platform was developed as a clean and minimalistic modern web application with support for six content providers; Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube (subscription feed), Tumblr and RSS. The social feeds were presented side-by-side as an overview and utilized modern real-time streaming techniques for content updates.

## My Role

My main tasks on this project were:

* Automatic provisioning of the servers and development environment through Vagrant and Docker
* Creating, managing and testing the backend in Node.js
* Ensuring the quality on the backend by writing unit tests.
* Integrating more social providers such as Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Tumblr
* Making sure the site stays up and running 24/7 (We had a peek of 3.000 new people within the first hour after being featured on Lifehacker)
* Creating the initial Android application

## Accomplishments

* 3.000 new users within the first hour after being featured on Lifehacker
* Featured on key websites such as Lifehacker, Buffer, Knack, ...
* 20.000 new users within the first week of going live

## Outcome

Feedient launched it’s public beta in April 2014 and was shut down a year later, in April 2015, partly because of increasingly tough third party restrictions from the social networks ([read all about it](http://www.quora.com/What-has-Facebook-done-to-their-API-terms-that-made-Feedient-shut-down-and-Pixable-face-some-problems-with-their-app/answer/Jesper-Lindstr%C3%B6m?srid=22qn&share=1)). During this year we obtained about 80 000 unique visitors, peaking at about 400 concurrent visitors. Collectively all visitors spent a jaw-dropping 26 years of time using our service, at one hour per visit on average – something which we’re very proud of. We were also featured in tech publications such as [Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/feedient-puts-your-twitter-facebook-and-instagram-fee-1569416764) and [Olhar Digital](http://olhardigital.uol.com.br/noticia/site-reune-facebook-twitter-youtube-e-instagram/41719) by Brazilian UOL.
