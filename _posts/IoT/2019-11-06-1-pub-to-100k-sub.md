I decided to do something exciting and challenging for personal growth in my Data & AI area and posed myself the hypothesis: "Can I create a system that with a few publishers but a massive amount of subscribers?" with the constraints of:
* Should be easy to maintain (as much PaaS as possible)
* Should be easy to scale (can I autoscale? Container support? ...)
* Should be able to handle real-time data flows (a real pub/sub system!)

Thinking back this was something I actually encountered [before in 2014](https://github.com/sockjs/sockjs-node/issues/156) while working on the [Feedient](https://xaviergeerinck.com/projects/feedient) [socket implementation](https://github.com/Feedient/Server/blob/060184240f6028b4f29a76d884df9345561878dc/src/lib/socket.js), here however I was utilizing SockJS and only had a need for around 20k connected clients.

After doing some research on different Azure components (since it's my comfort zone), I came to the following conclusion:
* **Apache Kafka:** We can go high here, but it seems to be a [bad design](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46284641/maximum-subscription-limit-of-kafka-topics-per-consumer). Next to that, it instantly starts off at 1.8k for a base HA cluster... 
* **Redis:** Might be possible! I could however not find anything about this (if anyone knows, please comment below :))
* Azure Event Hubs: Not possible, it will scale well but would be too expensive + there is a limit of around [3200 connections ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-quotas)
    * Note: this could be increased through dedicated event hubs or contacting support but this would grow too expensive
* **Azure Event Grid:** [500 / topic](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/master/includes/event-grid-limits.md)
    * Note: this could potentially be increased by multiple chained Event Grids, but this would cause too much implementation work on the moment
* **Azure Service Bus:** [2.000 subscriptions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-quotas) on the basic or standard tier
    * Note: Again, can be increased but not ideal for the use case of growing towards > 10k connections.

After checking all of the above, I came to the conclusion that nothing in my existing skill portfolio is going to cover this... so I started my search online. After a bit of searching I came on a product calledd [emqx.io](https://www.emqx.io/) which sounded reasonable! And actually it was!

5 minutes later, I found and deployed the [docker container](https://hub.docker.com/u/emqx/) through the following command:

> Note: This is being deployed on a 1 GB RAM, 1 vCPU container instance on Azure

```bash
# Create container
az container create \
    -g General \
    --name emqx \
    --dns-name-label xemqx \
    --image emqx/emqx:latest \
    --cpu 1 \
    --memory 1 \
    --ports 1883 8883 8083 8084 8080 18083
```

With the port mapping being:

|Port|Name|isPrivate?|
|-|-|-|
|1883|MQTT|No|
|8883|MQTT/SSL|No|
|8083|MQTT/Websocket|No|
|8084|MQTT/Websocket/SSL|No|
|8080|Management API|No|
|18083|Dashboard|No|
|4369|Node Discovery|Yes|
|5369|Cluster RPC|Yes|
|6369|Cluster Channel|Yes|

After which I could open the dashboard by loading the FQDN:18083:

## Stress Testing - 10k Connections

Ok, so we now got our broker done. How can we actually start stress testing? Well for this I wrote a small script that we can just execute locally:

**client.js**

```javascript
const mqtt = require('mqtt')
const noOfClients = process.env.CLIENT_CONNECTIONS || 250; // How many clients to create?
const serverUrl = process.env.CLIENT_URL;

console.log(`Connecting ${noOfClients} to ${serverUrl}`);

for (let clientNo = 1; clientNo <= noOfClients; clientNo++) {
    // Unique MQTT Object per client
    const client = mqtt.connect(serverUrl)

    client.on('connect', () => {
        client.subscribe('test-message', (err) => {

            console.log(`Client Connected #${clientNo}`);
            if (err) {
                console.log(err);
                // client.publish('presence', 'Hello mqtt')
            }
        })
    })

    client.on('message', (topic, message) => {
        // message is Buffer
        console.log(`Client #${clientNo} Received: ${message.toString()}`)
        client.end(); // In this test we instantly end them
    })
}

console.log(`Connected ${noOfClients} clients`);
```

**package.json**

```json
{
  "name": "mqtt-tester",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Testing mqtt subscriptions",
  "main": "client.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "async-mqtt": "^2.4.2",
    "mqtt": "^3.0.0"
  }
}
```

After executing this locally with `CLIENT_CONNECTIONS=10000 CLIENT_URL=mqtt://xemqx.northeurope.azurecontainer.io node client.js` I got to 10k connections! With a stable running `EMQX` service.

![/assets/images/posts/pub-sub/10k.png](/assets/images/posts/pub-sub/10k.png)

Next to that, I could also send to my subscribers by utilizing this small script (nothing fancy, I know):

**sender.js**

```javascript
const mqtt = require('mqtt')
const client = mqtt.connect('mqtt://xemqx.northeurope.azurecontainer.io')

client.on('connect', () => {
    let i = 1;

    setInterval(() => {
        i++;
        client.publish('test-message', `Hello World: #${i}`);
        console.log(`Sent Message ${i}`);
    }, 1000)
});
```

However when wanting to go higher, I started noticing delays on my computer not being able to handle the amount of subscriptions open... so back to the drawing board!

## Stress Testing - 28k Connections

How can we improve this? Well one simple way is to create a docker container that we can put on a cloud host and simply spin up more instances! So let's do just that and create a Dockerfile + build the image.

**Dockerfile**

```bash
# Note: build with `docker build -t thebillkidy/mqtt-tester:1.0 .`
# Note: push to docker hub with: `docker push thebillkidy/mqtt-test:1.0`
FROM node:latest
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Install package.json dependencies
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

# Install app
COPY . .

# Default ENV variables
# Note: specify those while running `docker run -e CLIENT_URL=mqtt://localhost`
ENV CLIENT_CONNECTIONS=1000
ENV CLIENT_URL='mqtt://localhost'

CMD [ "node", "client_massive.js" ]
```

Finishing with building the container and pushing it so that we can use it.

But how can we now deploy this on cloud? Well in Azure we can use the `az cli` to create out containers after being pushed. **So creating a small line we can multiply this * 50!**

```bash
for i in {1..50}; do az container create -g POC-EMQX --name subscriber-$RANDOM --image thebillkidy/mqtt-tester:1.0 --cpu 1 --memory 1 --environment-variables CLIENT_CONNECTIONS=10000 CLIENT_URL=mqtt://xemqx.northeurope.azurecontainer.io --no-wait; echo "Deployed Container $i"; done
```

Allowing a couple of minutes to make sure the containers are being spun up, we can now check the dashboard again. **However!** it seems that it's crashing at around 28k connections...

Looking at our statistics of the machine, we see that the memory cap is close to being hit - so let's see if we can work on this.

## Stress Testing - 100k Connections

Rather than deploying our `emqx` container with 1GB of RAM and 1 CPU, let's take 4 of both and retry. 

```
# Create container
az container create \
    -g General \
    --name emqx \
    --dns-name-label xemqx \
    --image emqx/emqx:latest \
    --cpu 4 \
    --memory 4 \
    --ports 1883 8883 8083 8084 8080 18083
```

With a script to create 50 x 2k connections

```bash
for i in {1..50}; do az container create -g POC-EMQX --name subscriber-$RANDOM --image thebillkidy/mqtt-tester:1.0 --cpu 1 --memory 1 --environment-variables CLIENT_CONNECTIONS=2000 CLIENT_URL=mqtt://xemqx.northeurope.azurecontainer.io --no-wait; echo "Deployed Container $i"; done
```

Which after a while of waiting to allow the subscriptions to come up shows us!

![/assets/images/posts/pub-sub/100k-stats.png](/assets/images/posts/pub-sub/100k-stats.png)

So we did it, we scaled it to 100k subscribers!

## Further

So the above is by no means a production system, it's merely a POC showing that we can scale to a certain amount of users. For further research I would like to scale this up towards 1M and even 10M subscribers. To do this, I would need to adapt the tooling written to make sure it scales better (there is a container limit and I can only open 2k subscribers per container in a stable way on this size). Next to that, does it not show how to run this in production and maintain it for a longer amount of time.
