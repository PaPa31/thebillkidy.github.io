So we learned all about starting our culture, and the base values that a influential leader should have (see FICEL, talked about in [Part 1](../)). But once we are this leader, how do we create a growth culture? Well this is all about **Motivation**.

Now how do we create this motivation? Put yourself in the shoes of a leader (or manager in this case), how do you make your people thrive?

## Creating Motivation

A common misconception is that people work harder when they see rewards. Just think about the area of sales where employees receive a bonus when they reach their targets. According to a study, this is however not the truth. When comparing two sets of employees - one with rewards, the other without - it has been proven that the one without rewards seems to provide better results.

Therefore, we should focus on creating a culture about making people motivated without providing rewards, or also called **Intrinsic Motivation**. By focusing on just three points, we are able to boost this motivation:

* **Purpose:** When people have a purpose, they are more eager to work towards a self-set goal.
* **Autonomy:** But to allow them to work towards self-set goals, we should provide them with the autonomy to do so.
* **Mastery:** And last but not least, to help them accomplish their purpose, provide them with the right training.

## Examples of Intrinsic Motivations

### Google

One of the most famous examples is Google who lets their employees work on their own projects for 20% of their time (called the 20% time rule).

This has the benefits of giving your employees the autonomy and mastery that they need, but also adds a benefit of that your company starts exploring new solutions (remember the *exploration* subject from part 1?)

### Zynga

Zynga goes even a step further. They allow employees to take **unlimited holidays** whenever they want it for as long as they want. They trust their employees to take the correct decisions when it matters, to improve in their job.

This is the perfect example on how you can provide *Autonomy* towards your employees.
