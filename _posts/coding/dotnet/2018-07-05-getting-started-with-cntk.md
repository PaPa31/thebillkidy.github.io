After learning Reinforcement learning for a while, I came to a new area that needed some "understanding" before I could continue my quest into the inner parts of it. It is on grasping the way that we can teach machines to recognize images through the use of neural networks. Now seeing that Neural Networks on themselves are covered very well by [other people](https://medium.com/@ageitgey/machine-learning-is-fun-part-3-deep-learning-and-convolutional-neural-networks-f40359318721) I won't go too much in detail on what a Neural Net is, instead I'd rather go more in depth on how we can actually work with it through a framework called **CNTK** and **dotnet core** to work towards implementing a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) 

CNTK? CNTK stands for the [*Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit*](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK) and is an open-source deep-learning toolkit developed by Microsoft that allows you to describe neural networks as a series of computational steps via a directed graph.
