A couple of months ago it struck me that my personal knowledge in AI could be improved quite a bit. That's why I took the time to brush up on the different concepts ranging from data gathering until the evaluation of a deployed model.

While brushing up my knowledge, I also thought on how I could share this back to the community as well as have a quick overview of everything I learned with pointers and tips of where I should look at to go more in depth on a topic. Making me end up in creating the following battle cards that I hope are useful for everyone to print and use as a kind of "Cheat Sheets".

> **Note:** I realize that these are far from perfect, but I want them to be. If you encounter any remarks, please post them below and I will look at incorporating them :)
