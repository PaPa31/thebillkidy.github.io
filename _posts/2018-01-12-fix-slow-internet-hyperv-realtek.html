When working with the awesome Visual Studio Android Emulator, I encountered the following error:

<strong>Issue:</strong> Internet speed gets divided by a factor of 10x when creating a Hyper-V machine that uses a vSwitch bound on the main Network Interface (nic).

<strong>Solution:</strong>

Open adapter settings -&gt; Right click towards properties -&gt; Configure your network adapter

Now disable the following settings:
<ul>
 	<li>IPv4 checksum offload</li>
 	<li>Large Send Offload (IPv4)</li>
 	<li>TDP Checksum Offload IPv4</li>
 	<li>UDP Checksum Offload IPv4</li>
</ul>
After disabling these settings my internet speed went back to its original speed :) hope this helped!

<strong>Note:</strong> <strong>For</strong> people with a <strong>Broadcom</strong> adapter, I recommend looking after disabling VMQ (Virtual Machines Queue) which seems to be an issue as well
