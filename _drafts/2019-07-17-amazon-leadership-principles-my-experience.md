In the spirit of being transparent and open-minded, I like exploring other technologies and thoughts of how people and organizations think. Recently I came across the *Amazon Leadership Principles* and the *Memo Idea* which I think are excellent practices which I would like to share my personal thoughts on.

## Memo System

Within Amazon, there is the notion of a Memo System. This is a system that is very simple, but which is something that a lot of companies still do wrong. It states that: "Rather than briefing everyone in the meeting, create a memo like briefing that everyone reads up front. Leading to a more interesting conversation in the actual meeting (with additional benefits, such as shorter meetings)."

This is personally something I like a lot. Currently I spend a huge chunk of my time watching PowerPoints of numbers, that I would rather have had upfront, to then **being able to deep dive upon them and ask my questions in the meeting itself**. Next to that, one of the biggest additional benefits is that **introvert people also have a bigger chance to ask questions**. 

## Leadership Principles

### Customer Obsession

**Definition:** *Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.*

**My Thoughts and examples:**

I believe that the heart of any company should lie at that of the customers. You can not run a business, without being dedicated to your customers and doing anything that is within your power to help them.

Personally, this is something I have fought for quite a lot already in my - still young - career. One time for example, I had to choose between positioning our internal services team versus what was better for the customer (speaking in millions here). Where I made the choice to position an alternative that included only a fraction of the internal services, with a roadmap towards the future to make everything fit better. Management went over my head quite a lot here, up to a point of them contacting other partners - which are now even competitors - since they did not trust my judgement. In the end, the customer chose for my proposal and is willing to move forward, having us set up for success.

What I learned here is my main key lesson in life. "Never give up and stay true to yourself". We are who we are as humans, and even though we get setbacks, we should push for what we think is right. Eventually landing up in a consensus that suits everyone.


### Ownership

**Definition:** *Leaders are owners. They think long term and don't sacrifice long-term value for short-terms results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say, "that's not my job".*

**My Thoughts and examples:**

Currently my Job is of a technical purpose, focusing purely on the customers and not the partner side of a customers. This is however an internal rule, and we should fight for our customer on every front we can that is within our reach.

Here I have 2 main examples:

1. A customer of mine is both a partner and an internal customer, where the partner part is supposed to be served by another team internally. I however go against this, since I believe them to be of service in the long-term strategy of my plan, which would eventually merge this effort into the ongoing internal customer projects.
2. I am working on a project with a customer that is tracking IoT devices. In the beginning however, I quickly detected that the solution wouldn't scale well, quickly showing up bottlenecks around 400 devices, where it was supposed to manage hundreds of thousands of them. In the short term, we re-architected this solution as a sort of POC solution, with in the long-term we are chasing to solve the business model, include an ecosystem and scale to the numbers they need (multi-year engagement).

### Invent and Simplify

**Definition:** *Leader expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by "not invented here". As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.*

**My Thoughts and examples:**

"A good programmer is a lazy one" - this is a famous quote that ruled my entire life already. This is something I live by and will keep living by. Programmers are smart enough to detect that they are doing repetitive tasks. That's why we should automate as much as possible, since its ROI will keep on growing in time once we solved it. (FYI - It's also something Facebook lives by)

Within the short period of time at my current employer, I already worked on a couple of projects to do just this:

* I created a tool that allows us to more easily insert CRM details. Since back then the CRM tool was very slow, hard to insert and took ages to keep everything up to date.
* I created a script that will automatically capture the Consumed Revenue on my accounts and email my weekly with the status. With as purpose to get me insights into my account, but also to increase customer obsession, where I am able to warn my customers when I see unusual peaks.

### Are Right, A Lot

**Definition:** *Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek to diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.*

**My Thoughts and examples:**

At my current role, I got the feedback that "I am not humble" enough since the beginning. It is something I admit, and it's something I am working on to be more politically direct, but it's something that's in my genes and something that will always be there. I am not perceived as being humble, since I always know better. This seems like this, but the reason that it is like this, is because I form my own thoughts and constantly work together with other entities (people, websites, video, books, ...) to improve those thoughts. I am always open - and even encourage - for people to challenge me, so that I can improve myself and also learn more from others.

### Learn and Be Curious

**Definition:** *Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.*

**My Thoughts and examples:**

You should be as a sponge, sucking up all the knowledge around you to constantly keep on improving yourself. I for example did this in a couple of different ways:

1. Since I was 15 years old, I was working on "Start-up Projects" with their sole purpose being to learn new technologies. 
2. As soon as something is released that spikes my interest, I instantly invest on it.
   * I started with GraphQL in a project in 2017 already (when it just came out)
   * I am focusing on specializing in Reinforcement Learning, since I believe it to be the future of humanity.

### Hire and Develop the Best

**Definition:** Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others. We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career choice.

**My Thoughts and examples:**

I am not a people manager yet, but however have the purpose of being one for a product development team. To however already start working on this, I am currently working in close collaboration with 2 people out of work that I deem to be "High-Potential", preparing them for the future ahead of them.

### Insist on the Highest Standards

**Definition:** *Leaders have relentlessly high standards - many people may think these standards are unreasonable high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and drive their teams to deliver high quality products, services, and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.*

**My Thoughts and examples:**

I like to tell everyone that I suffer from "OCD". Everything should be near-perfect, achieving he top 20% rather than the lower 80%. This is something that is hard to explain, but easy to give examples for.

> Note: Even though everything has to be perfect, you should still make a balance between what already exists, and what you should do from scratch. **Do not re-invent the wheel**.

* When I code, I like to watch the code and make sure it's reasonable. 
* When a pixel is out of line, I will perfect it until its beautifully aligned 
* When I see PowerPoints, I will redesign them to fit a common theme and design language that spikes the customer their interest.
  * Example: I recently went to a customer, where I completely redesigned a PowerPoint the day before just because I wanted it to look in the colours of the customer, reflect their business values and make sure the eye loves what it sees.
* When I see architectures or create architectures, I redesign them in the components I made, to have full control over them and achieve the highest standard needed. 

And yes, my colleagues think I am crazy ;-)

### Think Big

**Definition:** *Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.*

**My Thoughts and examples:**

Strategies should be created for the following 3 years, not for the next month. When I start my engagements, I tend to look at the already existing IT infrastructure, business needs and architectures. Re-designing it when I see flaws and making sure that I execute my engagements over the next 3 years.

> Note: This is something that currently is hard, since results are expected to come within the year, whereas I think to far ahead. - Room for improvement :) 


### Bias for Action
**Definition:** *Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking.*

**My Thoughts and examples:**

Or putting it in 2 different sentences: 

* "first-to-market advantage" is something that rules the world. 
* "Fail fast"

Don't wait, calculate on what you would lose and instantly start.

One of my customers currently is already doubting for more then 6 months to move towards the defined target architecture. Creating internal struggles since people want to move, as well as losing money since they have to dedicate headcounts to it to explore the deep dive study. Rather than doing this, calculate the risk of when something would fail and just try it. If it fails, no worries! Just try again until you get it right. Just make sure that you fail safe.

### Frugality
**Definition:** *Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size, or fixed expense.*

**My Thoughts and examples:**

The first thing that shocked me when I entered a big enterprise is the amount of money being spent on trips, customers visits and own expenses. Back then I came from a student background, where we were used to saving our money, since it was scarce.

I recently read a post on Facebook where Steve Jobs was phrased, with as snippet:

* If we take a wallet or handbag of \$300 or \$30, the space within is the same
* If we take a car of \$150.000 or \$10.000, they will both drive the same road and distance
* If we drink a bottle of wine of \$300 or \$10, they both will give you a hangover
* If we buy a house of 45sqm or 3000sqm, the loneliness will be the same

You can only get customer dedication by spending the money on them! Love your customer, threat them well and they will do the same for you. It's something that is closely related with customer obsession.

This is something I used a lot in my start-up projects, you have to start cheap to make it, since money is a scarcity. A server of 50\$ or 5\$? Take the one of 5\$ if you can make it work for your project! Re-architecture, Re-structure- Optimize your solutions to **bring you the best value for money!**

### Earn Trust
**Definition:** *Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team's body odor smells of perfume. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.*

**My Thoughts and examples:**

Know what your customer wants and work from this!

The best example I can give here is what a customer of me once said: **"Xavier, we know that you are young and will make mistakes sometimes - it's something that's human - but we know that we can come to you since you will get us the result!".** Which is something that always stuck with me. Listen to your customers and do what they need, do not come with an overselling of products A, B and C if product A will do.

### Dive Deep
**Definition:** *Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are sceptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task is beneath them.*

**My Thoughts and examples:**

Illustrating this with an example: Why is consumption the size it is? Do we understand the load? Do we know why it is declining or rising? Fill in the gaps in life! Do not let them stay unknown. Challenge yourself often on the things you learned, to make sure you are up to date with the latest knowledge.

At Christmas eve a customer of mine had an increase of its bill by $7.000 which was an anomaly for the load they were doing. I instantly dropped out of the dinner for 5mins to warn them to make sure we could resolve this issue as quickly as possible. Eventually - since the customer was unresponsive - this grew by even more but was luckily halted earlier since we were able to dive into it as quickly as possible.

### Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit
**Definition:** *Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.*

**My Thoughts and examples:**

I once got an awesome quote by one of my mentors that exists out of 2 bullets:

* When a CVP asks you something, say NO
* When an EVP asks you something, say you will do your research and then say NO.

This is the biggest lesson in life, rather than accepting everything the way it is, challenge it in a respectful way, since this is the way to innovation.

An example of this happened quite recently. My accounts got switched and I lost an account that I wanted to continue on since I believed I could be of more use there (impact wise and strategic wise). So, I thus first discussed this with my manager, after which I then escalated this through the right channels to make this change happen (since the manager said it was this way and couldn't be changed).

### Deliver Results
**Definition:** *Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.*

**My Thoughts and examples:**

Nothing better to illustrate this than with an example that recently happened: I had a customer that had deadlines and key deliverable. Seeing the size and impact that this would generate, I instantly put everything aside for 2 weeks and went on-site with this customer, to sit next to them and help them generate their deliverables as quickly as possible.
