* Moving people towards what you want takes time
* Take the time to understand your role in the beginning (+- 1 week)
  * For example, if you need to influence people, map the key stakeholders and think how you can "bound" with them
* Set weekly goals (KPIs) for yourself to measure impact, some examples:
  * X weekly customer meetings
  * X new engagements spotted
  * X follow ups
* If you spot a problem, automate it!
  * Automatic Twitter discovery for uses @ certain company
  * Following people on Twitter through Lists in Tweetdeck
