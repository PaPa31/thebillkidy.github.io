In the last few years I learned a lot, going from a student, evolving into an enterpreneur in several startups and now being employed at one of the biggest Tech Firms in the world.

, tmany would say that your success is your path to growth, I would say that your path to growth is by the failures you make over the years and how you learn from them to prevent them from happening again. Do not think of failures as radical things, do however think of them as you being bold, trying something

Focus on MVP
Categorize Must Haves, Nice to haves and focus on the Must Haves first
Implement only what you need now, do not overthink
Work in implementation phases (often called sprints)

## Learnings
Team is important, have people that can do design, coding but also marketing and business
* Design: Everything popular is what attracts people, it's key to have a strong Designer
* Coding: Initially, focus on features and speed. Iterate quickly  
* Marketing: Go-To-Market is the most important part of any business, how will you get the initial traction? Define your spendings on Customer Acquisation Costs (CAC) and Lifetime Value (LTV) of the users
* Business: How will you generate revenue? Create a Business Model Canvas and see how you can partner with others

## Case Study
Case Study / Learnings Applied: fortnitecreativelist.com (personal project)

Created design showing just that, a list of servers
* First focused on designing the list, then worked on adding the header + background
Then worked on coding this and putting it into production ASAP
Must Haves: Login, Logout, Register, View Servers, View Server
