Now we know what the  [Markov Property, Chain, Reward Process and Decision Process](/markov-property-chain-reward-decision) are, we can go more in detail on why they are actually so useful in the domain of Reinforcement Learning. 


But let's first start by connecting them with our [Policy and Value Function](/rl-intro).
