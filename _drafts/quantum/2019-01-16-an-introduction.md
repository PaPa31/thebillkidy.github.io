Quantum Computing is a hype growing more and more these days, but what is it? Why should we use it and how can we get started with it? This is what I would like to tackle in this post.

## Quantum Computing?

As written in the excellent publication by [Richard P. Feynman - Simulating Physics with Computers](/assets/pdf/Richard_P_Feynman-Simulating_Physics_With_Computers.pdf), we would like to have a kind of computer that does exactly the same as nature. A computer that is able to simulate the real world better, and next to that allows us to tackle larger and more complex problems. Think for example about problems such as:

* Quantum Chemistry
* Quantum Dynamics
* Material Science
* Optimization Problems
* Sampling
* Secure Computing
* Cryptography
* Machine Learning
* Searching

To solve these kind of problems, we need to fundamentally change computers as they work now, transforming from classical `bits` towards `qubits`. But what are qubits?



Before we are able to come to the how, let's go more in depth on
